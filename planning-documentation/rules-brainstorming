limit max card rank to something small, like 6, but keep distinct tiers of attacks
for each of the 6 ranks. in addition, smaller more focused decks. however, to
balance the loss of power, say every round you don't drop from the max momentum,
increases your momentum by another X, where X is:
  + a flat 1
  + flat increment, i.e X=# of turns at max momentum
  + the last two momentum gains' sum (i.e. Fibonachi seq., could give advantage
    to a strat of discarding a bunch of cards but a couple of max-rank cards, then
    getting a very sudden spike in momentum, although it would take work to get
    that move in position)
this also leads to the possibility (because of smaller decks) of adding eight
common pools of cards (blades(+), stones(+), bones(+), stars(+)), which is more
feasible (and perhaps necessary) if the class pools are limited
