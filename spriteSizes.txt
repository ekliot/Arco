With a screen size of 1280x720...

A card has a h:w ratio of 5:3.5, and is 150x105px in 720p (15/128 of height, 7/48 of width).

The top 160px (2/9 of height) are reserved for the opponent's card-hand, deck, and vitals area.
	The deck is located at the leftmost edge, and the cards that are in-hand start next to the deck to its right.
	The vitals are located at the rightmost edge, and each have a diameter of 70px and a buffer of 5px (so they occupy an 80px square, or half of area height).

The bottom 200px (5/18 of height) are reserved for the player's card-hand, deck, vitals, and commands area.
	The very bottom 40px (1/15 of height) are for command buttons (PLAY, DISCARD, SORT, PASS) starting from the leftmost edge.
	The 160px above the buttons are the same as for the opponent's area.

The remaining vertical 360px (1/2 of height) are for the active cards, which start at the leftmost end with the lowest-ranked cards and increment from there.
	These 360px are divided into two 150px-tall strips with 15px in between each other and in between the strip and the player areas.
